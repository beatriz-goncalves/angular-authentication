# angular-authentication

This project is an authentication application that allows users to login and create new accounts through Login and Signup Forms. The main goal is to provide a complete authentication solution that does not rely on an external API.

The project includes an integrated authentication service, developed in-house, that manages the creation and validation of user accounts. In addition, the application ensures the security of login information through cryptographic techniques and secure storage of passwords.
